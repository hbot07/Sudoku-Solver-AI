### Artificial Intelligence that solves Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem(CSP)  

Consider the Sudoku puzzle as pictured below. There are 81 variables in total, i.e. the tiles to be filled with digits. Each variable is named by its row and its column, and must be assigned a value from 1 to 9, subject to the constraint that no two cells in the same row, column, or box may contain the same value.  

## Execution
$ python3 driver.py <input_string>  
replacing "<input_string>" with any valid string representation of a Sudoku board  
For Example:

The Sudoku board in the diagram shown above is represented as the string:

00302060090030005001001806400... (and so on)
